/* In the original CSS - the inner box was shifted 10 pixels down using "position", but the offset was "absolute", meaning 10 pixels from the top left point of the screen.
When I changed the position to "relative" - the shift was relative to the upper left point of the element within which the inner box nests, i.e. relative to the outer box. */
